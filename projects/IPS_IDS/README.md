Implementing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) in a lab is a fantastic way to learn network security and threat detection.
Here are some steps for hands-on practice with IDS/IPS concepts, tools, and configurations:

### 1. **Set Up Snort or Suricata for Network IDS/IPS**
   - **Objective**: Install and configure a popular open-source IDS/IPS tool (Snort or Suricata) to detect malicious traffic in a lab network.
   - **Steps**:
      1. Install Snort or Suricata on a Linux VM.
      2. Configure it to monitor traffic on a test network or a specific network interface.
      3. Use pre-built rule sets (like ET Open Rules for Suricata) to detect common attack patterns.
      4. Generate traffic to test detection capabilities, such as port scans or simple attacks using tools like **Nmap** or **hping3**.

### 3. **Implement Host-Based IDS (HIDS) with OSSEC**
   - **Objective**: Set up and configure a Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) to monitor file changes, logins, and system events.
   - **Steps**:
      1. Install OSSEC on a VM to monitor the host's files and logs.
      2. Configure OSSEC to alert on specific events, such as unauthorized logins, file modifications, or privilege escalations.
      3. Simulate potential threats by creating suspicious activities, like modifying sensitive files or trying to access restricted directories.
      4. Check OSSEC logs and alerts to see how it detects these events.
   - **Tools**: OSSEC, a Linux VM, scripting to simulate changes and intrusions.
   - **Learning Outcome**: Understand host-based intrusion detection and practice setting up monitoring for critical system files and processes.

### 4. **Network Anomaly Detection with Zeek (formerly Bro)**
   - **Objective**: Use Zeek to monitor and analyze network traffic for unusual patterns that might indicate an attack.

   - **Learning Outcome**: Gain experience in centralizing and visualizing IDS logs for improved threat detection and analysis.

### 7. **Simulate DDoS Detection and Mitigation in IDS**
   - **Objective**: Configure IDS/IPS to detect signs of DDoS attacks and practice mitigation tactics.
   - **Steps**:
      1. Set up an IDS (Suricata or Snort) to monitor network traffic.
      2. Use traffic generation tools (e.g., **Apache Benchmark** or **hping3**) to simulate DDoS-like conditions.
      3. Configure rules to detect traffic patterns indicative of DDoS, such as high connection rates from a single IP or multiple concurrent connections.
      4. Implement automatic responses (like blocking IPs) to prevent further traffic when DDoS behavior is detected.
   - **Tools**: Snort/Suricata, Apache Benchmark, hping3.
   - **Learning Outcome**: Practice identifying and responding to DDoS traffic using IDS/IPS, gaining skills in automated defense tactics.

Each of these projects provides a strong foundation in IDS/IPS concepts and practical skills. By working through these scenarios, you'll become familiar with different detection methods, tool configurations, and response techniques to build a more secure network.

## Bonus Challenge. Setting up a honeypot with automatic redirection of malicious traffic

### 1. **Set Up Your Honeypot Web Server**
   - **Choose a Honeypot Solution**: A popular choice for web-related honeypots is **Dionaea**, which is designed to capture malware and attacks targeting vulnerable services. Alternatively, you can use **Cowrie** (for SSH and Telnet) if your focus is on logging attacker actions.
   - **Install and Configure**: Deploy the honeypot on a VM or isolated machine. Ensure it’s reachable on the network but doesn’t hold any real data or sensitive information.
   - **Run the Honeypot**: Configure it to listen on the desired ports (e.g., HTTP on port 80, SSH on port 22). Log all incoming traffic for analysis.

### 2. **Set Up an IDS for Detection**
   - **Install and Configure IDS (e.g., Suricata or Snort)**: Install an IDS that can monitor incoming traffic and detect malicious patterns.
   - **Write or Enable Detection Rules**:
     - Enable or write IDS rules that detect malicious activity, such as brute force, SQL injection attempts, known exploit signatures, or high-traffic rates.
     - For example, to detect potential DDoS traffic, you can use a rule that triggers when too many connections originate from a single IP within a short time.

### 3. **Create Redirection Rules with Firewall (iptables) or SDN**
   Once malicious traffic is detected, you can use firewall rules to redirect that traffic to your honeypot.

   #### Option A: Redirect with `iptables`
   - **Step 1**: Enable IP forwarding (on Linux):
     ```bash
     echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
     ```
   - **Step 2**: Use `iptables` to redirect malicious IPs to the honeypot.
     ```bash
     iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s <malicious_ip> -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination <honeypot_ip>:80
     ```
     This command forwards incoming HTTP traffic from `malicious_ip` to the honeypot’s IP. You can automate adding IPs based on IDS alerts.

   #### Option B: Automate with IDS and Scripts
   - **Setup**: Configure the IDS to run a script upon detection.
   - **Script Example**: When Suricata or Snort detects malicious traffic, it can trigger a script to add the attacker’s IP to `iptables` redirection rules.
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     MALICIOUS_IP=$1
     HONEYPOT_IP=<honeypot_ip>
     iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s $MALICIOUS_IP -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination $HONEYPOT_IP:80
     ```
   - **Automate Triggering**:
     - Configure the IDS to run this script whenever it detects specific traffic patterns. In Suricata, you can use the **eve.json** log to trigger the script when matching rules are detected.

### 4. **Configure Logging and Alerts**
   - **Honeypot Logging**: Ensure the honeypot logs all traffic and interactions.
   - **Centralized Logging**: Consider using a centralized logging setup (like the ELK stack) to consolidate logs from the IDS, firewall, and honeypot for easier analysis and alerting.
   - **Monitor and Respond**: Set alerts for high-priority events, such as successful honeypot connections, to receive notifications and investigate further.

### Example Workflow
1. **IDS Detection**: The IDS detects a malicious pattern (e.g., excessive HTTP requests) and flags the source IP as malicious.
2. **Redirect Traffic**: Using `iptables`, the detected IP is redirected to the honeypot server instead of the main web server.
3. **Log Malicious Activity**: The honeypot logs and captures interaction data from the attacker, providing valuable insights into attack methods and techniques.

This setup can effectively redirect and capture malicious activity for analysis without affecting your primary web server. It also gives you a chance to learn about real-time redirection and response tactics in a controlled environment.
